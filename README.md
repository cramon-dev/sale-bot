# sale-bot
A simple Discord bot that returns the current price and discounted percent of any requested game from Steam. 

# Installing
Run `npm install` in the base directory.

# Running
Run `npm start`.

# Troubleshooting
If CTRL + C doesn't seem to bring up the 'Terminate batch script' prompt, do it again. If all else fails, just kill the command window/node process. I'm currently trying to figure out why this works the way it does.
